# The value we can derive from data really depends on just two things – 
1] the accuracy of data and
2] the efficiency with which we’re able to access the data we need,  when we need it. 

# Future Scope :
Dice Tech Job Report of 2020 lists data engineering as the fastest-growing tech occupation with year-over-year growth of 50%.
To quote a Forbes 2020 report on data in the coming decade, “The constant increase in data processing speeds and bandwidth, the nonstop invention of new tools
for creating, sharing, and consuming data, and the steady addition of new data creators and consumers around the world, ensure that data growth continues unabated ”

A modern data ecosystem includes a whole network of:
+ interconnected
+ independent,
+ continually evolving entities

Ecosystem includes:
- data that has to be integrated from disparate sources;
- different types of analysis and skills to generate insights;
- active stakeholders to collaborate and act on insights generated;
- and tools, applications, and infrastructure to store, process, and disseminate data as required.

**Data sources**

Data is available in a variety of **structured** and **unstructured datasets**,
some data forms :
- text
- images
- videos
- social media platforms
- Internet of Things (or IoT) devices
- clickstreams
- user conversations
- real-time events that stream data
- legacy databases
- sourced from professional data providers and agencies. 

When you’re working with so many different sources of data

**Pull a copy of the data from the original sources into a data repository.** 

At this stage, you’re only looking at data collection that you need - working with data formats, sources, and interfaces through which this data can be pulled in. 

**Once the raw data is in a common place, it needs to get organized, cleaned up, and optimized for access by end-users.** 

Challenges 

- data management
- working with data repositories that provide high availability, flexibility, accessibility, and security.

**We have our business stakeholders, applications, programmers, analysts, and data science use cases all pulling this data from the enterprise data repository.** 

Challenges

- the interfaces,
- APIs,
- applications that can get this data to the end-users in line with their specific needs.

For example, Data Analysts may need the raw data to work with, business stakeholders may need reports and dashboards, applications may need custom APIs to pull this data.

# Different Data Roles and Responsibilities :

- Data Engineering converts raw data into usable data. 
- Data Analytics uses this data to generate insights. 
- Data Scientists use Data Analytics and Data Engineering to predict the future using data from the past. 
- Business Analysts and Business Intelligence Analysts use these insights and predictions to drive decisions that benefit and grow their business. 

Interestingly, it’s not uncommon for data professionals to start their career in one of the data roles and transition to another role within the data ecosystem by supplementing their skills.


Emerging technologies that are shaping today’s data ecosystem and its possibilities. 
For example, **Cloud Computing**, **Machine Learning**, and **Big Data**, to name a few.
