# The value we can derive from data really depends on just two things – 
1] the accuracy of data and
2] the efficiency with which we’re able to access the data we need,  when we need it. 

# Future Scope :
Dice Tech Job Report of 2020 lists data engineering as the fastest-growing tech occupation with year-over-year growth of 50%.
To quote a Forbes 2020 report on data in the coming decade, “The constant increase in data processing speeds and bandwidth, the nonstop invention of new tools
for creating, sharing, and consuming data, and the steady addition of new data creators and consumers around the world, ensure that data growth continues unabated ”

A modern data ecosystem includes a whole network of:
+ interconnected
+ independent,
+ continually evolving entities

Ecosystem includes:
- data that has to be integrated from disparate sources;
- different types of analysis and skills to generate insights;
- active stakeholders to collaborate and act on insights generated;
- and tools, applications, and infrastructure to store, process, and disseminate data as required.

# Enterprise advantage for using data  :
Today, organizations that are using data to uncover opportunities and are applying that knowledge to differentiate themselves are the ones leading into the future. 
- looking for patterns in financial transactions to detect fraud, 
- using recommendation engines to drive conversion, 
- mining social media posts for customer voice, 
- brands personalizing their offers based on customer behavior analysis, 
- business leaders realize that data holds the key to competitive advantage.

**Data sources**

Data is available in a variety of **structured** and **unstructured datasets**,
some data forms :
- text
- images
- videos
- social media platforms
- Internet of Things (or IoT) devices
- clickstreams
- user conversations
- real-time events that stream data
- legacy databases
- sourced from professional data providers and agencies. 

When you’re working with so many different sources of data

**Pull a copy of the data from the original sources into a data repository.** 

At this stage, you’re only looking at data collection that you need - working with data formats, sources, and interfaces through which this data can be pulled in. 

**Once the raw data is in a common place, it needs to get organized, cleaned up, and optimized for access by end-users.** 

Challenges 
- data management
- working with data repositories that provide high availability, flexibility, accessibility, and security.

**We have our business stakeholders, applications, programmers, analysts, and data science use cases all pulling this data from the enterprise data repository.** 

Challenges
- the interfaces,
- APIs,
- applications that can get this data to the end-users in line with their specific needs.

For example, Data Analysts may need the raw data to work with, business stakeholders may need reports and dashboards, applications may need custom APIs to pull this data.

# Different Data Roles and Responsibilities :
- Data Engineering converts raw data into usable data. 
- Data Analytics uses this data to generate insights. 
- Data Scientists use Data Analytics and Data Engineering to predict the future using data from the past. 
- Business Analysts and Business Intelligence Analysts use these insights and predictions to drive decisions that benefit and grow their business. 

Interestingly, it’s not uncommon for data professionals to start their career in one of the data roles and transition to another role within the data ecosystem by supplementing their skills.

Emerging technologies that are shaping today’s data ecosystem and its possibilities. 
For example, **Cloud Computing**, **Machine Learning**, and **Big Data**, to name a few.

- Programming languages such as Python, R, and Java. Shell and Scripting languages, such as Unix/Linux Shell and PowerShell. 
- Familiarity with Big Data processing tools such as Hadoop, Hive, and Spark. 


# Summary and Highlights
The role of a Data Engineer includes:
- Gathering data from disparate sources. Managing and cleaning data.
- Integrating data into a unified view for data consumers.
- Preparing data for analytics and reporting.
- Managing data pipelines for a continuous flow of data from source to destination systems.
- Managing the complete infrastructure for the collection, processing, and storage of data.
- data is highly available, consistent, secure, recoverable. 

To be successful in their role, Data Engineers need a mix of technical, functional, and soft skills.
- Technical Skills include working with different operating systems and infrastructure components such as virtual machines, networks, and application services. It also includes working with databases and data warehouses, data pipelines, ETL tools, big data processing tools, and languages for querying, manipulating, and processing data.
- An understanding of the potential application of data in business is an important skill for a data engineer. Other functional skills include the ability to convert business requirements into technical specifications, an understanding of the software development lifecycle, and the areas of data quality, privacy, security, and governance.
- Soft Skills include interpersonal skills, the ability to work collaboratively, teamwork, and effective communication.
