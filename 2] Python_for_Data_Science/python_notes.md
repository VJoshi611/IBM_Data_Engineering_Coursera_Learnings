- An API lets two pieces of software talk to each other. Just like a function, you don't have to know how the API works, only its inputs and outputs. An essential type of 
  API is a REST API that allows you to access resources via the internet. In this lab, we will review the Pandas Library in the context of an API.
- api helps to communicate with the api via inputs and outputs. Just like a function, you donâ€™t have to know how the API works, but just its inputs and outputs.
  eg: We use the pandas api to process the data by communicating with the other Software Components.
- REST APIs are another popular type of API; they allow you to communicate through the internet allowing you to take advantage of resources like storage, access more data,
  artificial intelligent algorithms.
- Rest API's function by sending a request, the request is communicated via HTTP message. The HTTP message usually contains a JSON file. This contains instructions for 
  what operation we would like the service or resource to perform. In a similar manner, API returns a response, via an HTTP message, this response is usually contained 
  within a JSON.
