**ETL**
- Module 1 covers Data Strategy and Planning,  Extract, Transform, and Load operations.
  Extract required information from web pages using web scraping techniques and APIs. Access(Query) databases using Python and save the processed information as a table in a database.
- Module 2: Final Project:- Develop ETL Pipeline.

- Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) operations are of extreme importance in the role of a Data engineer. A data engineer extracts data from multiple sources and different file formats, transforms the extracted data to predefined settings and then loads the data to a database for further processing.
  Eg:
   - Read CSV, JSON, and XML file types.
   - Extract the required data from the different file types.
   - Transform data to the required format.
   - Save the transformed data in a ready-to-load format, which can be loaded into an RDBMS

 
-  In this role you will be given a scenario and data set to begin your Python code creation. During this process you will perform specific tasks such as extracting data from different file formats, collecting data through APIs and webscraping and finally transforming the collected data into a ready-to-load format.
