- Data engineering roles in organizations tend to break the specialization up into Data Architecture, Database Design and Architecture, Data Platforms, Data Pipelines and ETL, Data Warehouses, and Big Data.

- Data Engineering is a fast-moving field. If youâ€™re curious, open to learning new things, and excited about technology, you will be a great asset to any data engineering team.

# Companies Requirement:**
- good analytical and problem solving skills in a data engineer
- asking additional questions just to figure out what direction to take something.
  eg : somebody comes to you, they say the database is slow. What do you do? And I'm not looking for them to say I tune memory. I'm not looking for them to say I look at this metric. I'm looking for them to ask questions and think about different directions of slowness we could come from, things like that.
- curiosity, good communications, and love for data.
- Softskills are too important.
  
**Technical Skills**
- SQL, data modeling, and ETL methodologies, as well as programming skills.
- skills on ONE RDBMS. They look for expertise on ONE NoSQL databases.

- open-source tools, or framing tools, with the support of enormous online learning materials
- try to share your knowledge with your peers in the community. For example, share your code in the GitHub public repositories or start writing articles on LinkedIn or create your own blog.
